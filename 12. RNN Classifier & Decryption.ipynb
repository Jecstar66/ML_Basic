        "For those who have not, *The Imitation Game* is a biographical film about the English mathematician and computer scientist [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing). During World War II, Germans heavily relied on the [enigma machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine) to encipher all their top-secret messages. If the Allies could decipher these messages, they would be able to prepare for the German attacks. This would definitely bring huge strategic advantages to the Allies. However, the enigma machine adopted an extremely sophisticated encryption mechanism that produced messages notoriously difficult to decipher.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the movie, Turing creates an electro-mechanical machine called [bombe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombe) that automatically iterates over all possible enigma configurations while ruling out configurations that do not make sense. The remaining configurations were then handed over to cryptanalysts to be carefully inspected. Since the enigma machine has about $1.6\\times 10^{20}$ different possible configurations, reducing the set size to a manageable number was crucial for deciphering.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, we will try to decipher a bunch of secret messages ourselves! In fact, we will go one step further and create a machine that not only rules out impossible configurations but also detects the enigma configuration used to encipher the message **and** decipher the message by itself, without any help from human experts. Sounds extremely challenging, doesn't it? But no worries, GRU-ce Almighty will take care of it for you! Unfortunately, $1.6\\times 10^{20}$ types of configurations are way too much to handle, even for our GRUs. Therefore, we have simplified the problem as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. We randomly selected **four** out of $1.6\\times 10^{20}$ possible configurations. You will only need to care about these four.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. We assume that the sentence structure and capitalization of the original message are preserved throughout the enciphering process. This can be very helpful in some instances. For example, if the cipher contains the word `B'a`, it would probably be `I'm`. If it has the word `Jzbvzrtn'o`, it would probably be a name followed by `'s`.\n",

        "As you can see, the dataset consists of text data. Since neural networks do not take text as input, we must convert them into numbers. The [`torchtext`](https://pytorch.org/text/stable/index.html) library provides a convenient tool called [`build_vocab_from_iterator`](https://pytorch.org/text/stable/vocab.html#build-vocab-from-iterator) for converting tokens to integers. Conventional natural language processing tasks utilize multi-character tokens because characters usually do not carry any meaning by themselves. However, the enigma problem does not have any natural multi-character tokenization scheme. So, we will just adopt character-based tokenization. Before starting, we need to figure out what kinds of characters are in the dataset. Note that the decipher datasets only contain lowercase alphabets, so we do not need to search through them."

One possible way would be to use different initial states for each configuration type while training those initial states together with the rest of the model.\n",
